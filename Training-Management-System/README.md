## 🚀 Training Management System – Salesforce Apex Project

### Project Overview
A Salesforce Apex project demonstrating real-world business logic, bulkified DML operations, trigger framework implementation, and asynchronous Apex concepts using a training-based use case.
This project is designed to showcase core Apex development skills, Salesforce best practices, and production-ready coding standards expected from a Salesforce Developer.


### Apex Concepts Covered
- Apex Classes with reusable business logic
- Bulkified DML operations (Insert, Update, Delete,Upsert,Undelete)
- Triggers and Trigger Handler pattern
- SOQL and Relationship Queries
- Database Methods and Exception Handling

### Asynchronous Apex
- Future Methods (Mixed DML handling)
- Queueable Apex (background jobs and chaining)
- Batch Apex (large data processing with error handling)
- Scheduled Apex (time-based automation)

### Business Scenarios Implemented
- Account, Contact, Lead, Case, and Opportunity automation
- Revenue-based and status-based updates
- Parent-child data processing using Apex
- Automated cleanup and batch processing
- Validation Rules for Data consistency

### Code Quality and Best Practices
- Bulk-safe logic (no SOQL or DML inside loops)
- Proper error handling using Database.SaveResult
- 99% Apex Overall code coverage
- Production-style, interview-ready code

### Key Components
- Business Classes
  - Car.cls
  - Mobile.cls
  - Rectangle.cls
  - BankAccount.cls
  - Employee.cls
  - Vehicle.cls
  - Pen.cls
  - Student.cls
  - Course.cls
- Dedicated Test Classes
  
### Triggers
 - Account Trigger
 - Contact Trigger
 - Opportunity Trigger
 - Case Trigger
 - Course Trigger
 - Lead Trigger
- Dedicated Respective Test Classes

### Validation Rules for
- Student Object
- Course Object
- Trainer Object
- Project Object
- Doctor Object
- Patient Object
- Campaign Object
- Lead Object
- Opportunity Object

### Why This Project Stands Out
- Demonstrates real Salesforce Apex skills
- Covers synchronous and asynchronous processing
- Clean GitHub structure for recruiter review

### Developer Skills Demonstrated
- Apex Programming
- SOQL and DML Operations
- Asynchronous Apex
- Salesforce Best Practices
- 99% Code Coverage
